# Welcome to the SOAFEE AWS IoT Fleetwise demo

The repository contains the instructions and code that allows you to reproduce the demo shown in the session [**Achieving environmental parity through multiple layers of abstractions helps to support AWS IoT FleeWise edge on EWAOL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1isAmTtp8) at [SOAFEE Virtual Symposium 2022](https://soafee.io/blog/2022/virtual_symposium/).

The demo will walk you through the exercise of running on [EWAOL](https://github.com/aws4embeddedlinux/meta-aws-ewaol) the [AWS IoT FleeWise](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/) Edge. The [AWS IoT FleeWise Edge](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge) will run in a [container](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge/aws-iot-fleetwise-edge) and the orchestration will be done with [k3s](https://k3s.io/). We can use the exact same container image both in the cloud and on a physical target, as long as they are based on an ARM v8 core. We also show how the [cdk8s](https://cdk8s.io/) framework can improve the software development process abstracting the orchestration layer.

## Getting started

Deploy Cloud 9 in one of the supported regions

[![Launch](https://samdengler.github.io/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/images/us-east-1.svg)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise-cloud9&templateURL=https://demo-soafee-aws-iot-fleetwise-eu-central-1.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud9-env.template.json)

[![Launch](https://samdengler.github.io/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/images/eu-central-1.svg)](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-central-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise-cloud9&templateURL=https://demo-soafee-aws-iot-fleetwise-eu-central-1.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud9-env.template.json)

Acknowledge the creation of the stack and press the button **Create stack** on the bottom right. 

![Create Stack](docs/createstack.png)

The ```demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise-cloud9``` CloudFormation stack will take about **3 minutes** to be created.

When stack creation has finished, [open Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home#) and, in a terminal, run the following script to create the cdk stack that will deploy all the cloud resources as shown on the architecture above

```sh
cd ~/environment/demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise
./scripts/resize-c9.sh 20
./scripts/deploy-cloud.sh
```

The above commands will take about **10 minutes** to complete. While you wait we encorage you to appreciate how the cloud resources gets deployed through [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) leveraging the [AWS IoT FleetWise Construct Library](https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-aws-iotfleetwise) having a look to [this file](https://github.com/aws-samples/demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise/blob/main/cloud/src/main.py).

### Get AWS FleetWise Edge running on the Build Host

This is the quickest option to see AWS IoT FleetWise running without having to build the EWAOL AMI, as detailed in the next paragraph.

We will be using the same orchestrator (k3s) used in EWAOL, so let's get started by installing it

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/kubectl /usr/bin/kubectl


###################################

# Install K3s with specific flags to work around cgroup issues
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=true sh -s 


#- --disable-cloud-controller --kubelet-arg="cgroup-driver=cgroupfs" #--kubelet-arg="feature-gates=SupportNodePidsLimit=false,SupportPodPidsLimit=false"

# Create the kubectl symlink
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/bin/kubectl /usr/bin/kubectl

kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get pods --all-namespaces
###########################
```

Build the Vehicle Simulator container image that will feeding signals on the CAN Bus Data where the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge is listening on

```sh
sudo ./scripts/build-vsim.sh
```

Load certificate and private key for the vehicle into k3s secrets. These have been created by ```./scripts/deploy-cloud.sh``` above

```sh
sudo /usr/local/bin/kubectl create secret generic private-key --from-file=./.tmp/private-key.key
sudo /usr/local/bin/kubectl create secret generic certificate --from-file=./.tmp/certificate.pem
```

Deploy the kubernetes manifest to k3s

```sh
# Install kernel development packages
sudo dnf install -y kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-modules-extra


./scripts/deploy-k3s.sh
```
The script shows you the AWS IoT FleetWise Edge log. If you stop the script with CTRL+C, this will terminate the containers. As such, if you want to run other commands without stopping the containers, open another terminal.

Now you can connect to the Vehicle Simulator Webapp opening the Cloud9 preview

![Preview menu](docs/preview%20menu.png)

You can try changing things such as opening/closing the vehicle doors and observe how the data signals values are fed into our Amazon Timestream table. You can either use [Amazon Timestream console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/timestream/home?#query-editor:) to run the query or you can paste the command below in one of the Cloud9 terminals.

```sh
aws timestream-query query --query-string \
  "SELECT * FROM FleetWise.FleetWise WHERE time > ago(5m) ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 2" \
  | jq -r '.Rows[].Data[].ScalarValue'
```

Please note that DoorsState is encoded on 5 bits and the value associated with each door is shown below. The left and right reference are from the point of view of facing the road ahead, while seated inside the vehicle.

|Value|Door|
|-|-|
|1|Front left|
|2|Front right|
|4|Rear left|
|8|Rear right|
|16|Vehicle trunk lid|

### Cleanup

From [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) just delete `demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise` and `demo-soafee-aws-iotfleetwise-cloud9` stacks.
